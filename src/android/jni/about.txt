 === Coventina ===

 - Game Jam 2016 -

Description:

Coventina is the goddess of wells and springs.  Coventina's Well is the
original Wishing Well, dating back about 2000 years, to the Romano-British era.

Coins are religious offerings to the goddess Coventina.  As a worshipper of
Coventina, you ritualistically give coin offerings to Coventina, and rings too,
because rings are nice, and Coventina likes to take the form of a Cuttlefish,
because why not?  Cuttlefish are amazing and smart, and they're brains are
ring-shaped.  So rings are special to the worshippers of Coventina.

As a devout follower of Coventina, you follow a very specific ritual when you
leave the temple and visit the well.  Coventina expects you to, and will be
angry if you don't.  To make Coventina (and yourself) happy after a session of
solemn worship, you make multiple offerings of two coins and one ring by
dropping them in the well above which Coventina (in her abstract swimming
cuttlefish form) floats.  But don't approach the well with more than two coins and one
ring, because you will be compelled to offer them all, yet only get credit for
the three.

Gameplay:
You win the game if you get 6 points.
Each time you approach the well water and have at least 2 coins and 1 ring, you get one point.
You have 90 seconds to make the 6 offerings.
If you run out of time, you lose.
